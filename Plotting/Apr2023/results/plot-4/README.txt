only looking at the couple of iterations that seem to have the significant deviations from the "expected" descent route

For h2o1b1, that's the first jastrow iteration and the second ci iteration
edesc 1b and 1c
gvptt 3b and 3c

For formn2p, it might be either the first jastrow iteration and the second ci iteration, 
or it might be the second jastrow iteration and the third ci iteration. 
Option 1:
edesc 1b and 1c
gvptt 1b and 1c
Option 2:
edesc 1d and 1e
gvptt 1d and 1e
